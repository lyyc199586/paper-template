    % One-dimensional simulations demonstrate that the Johnson-cook model is correctly cast into a variational framework. The ability of the model to capture shear band formation is demonstrated. Additionally, it is shown that the model can achieve mesh-insensitive shear band formation by including inertial, viscous, and conductive effects. Mesh insensitivity is demonstrated on a reduced compressive top hat simulation. Finally, a classical mode-III simulation shows the model's ability to capture experimental results under high-speed loading with shear and fracture failure.
